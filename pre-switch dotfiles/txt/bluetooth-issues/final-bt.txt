# Fixing Sony WH-CH720N Bluetooth Pairing on NixOS

## Initial Problem
- Headphones visible but won't pair
- Getting `AuthenticationRejected` and `InProgress` errors

## Prerequisites
Add these packages to your `configuration.nix`:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    bluez
    bluez-tools
    bluez-alsa    # critical for audio
    pavucontrol
    wireplumber
];
```

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Find Your Headphone's MAC Address**:
```bash
bluetoothctl
scan on
# Look for a device named "WH-CH720N"
# The MAC address will appear like "84:D3:52:32:B3:65" next to the name
```

2. **Clean Slate**: Reset all Bluetooth configurations
```bash
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

3. **Reset Audio System**: Clear PipeWire/PulseAudio configurations
```bash
systemctl --user stop pipewire pipewire-pulse
rm -rf ~/.config/pulse/*
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse
```

4. **Critical Pairing Sequence**:
```bash
bluetoothctl
power off
power on
scan on
# Put headphones in pairing mode
# Wait until you see "WH-CH720N" appear
# Note the MAC address shown with it
trust [MAC_ADDRESS]
pair [MAC_ADDRESS]
connect [MAC_ADDRESS]
```

The key insights:
- You need the proper packages installed first
- The MAC address appears when scanning with `bluetoothctl`
- The sequence of `trust → pair → connect` is important
- A clean slate (removing old configs) helps avoid conflicts

## Verification
- Check if services are running:
```bash
systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-pulse
systemctl status bluetooth
```

If it doesn't work immediately, try rebooting and repeating the pairing sequence.

Note: Replace `[MAC_ADDRESS]` with the actual MAC address that appears when scanning. The MAC address will be different each time you reset/re-pair the device.
