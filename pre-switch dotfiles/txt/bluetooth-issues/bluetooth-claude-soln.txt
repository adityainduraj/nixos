1. Make sure you have the complete Bluetooth audio stack:
   - Basic Bluetooth utilities
   - Bluetooth audio support (especially bluez-alsa)
   - PipeWire instead of PulseAudio
   - A Bluetooth manager (like Blueman)

2. Clear out any existing Bluetooth configurations and restart the services

3. Rebuild the system and reboot

That's really it - the issue was probably just missing Bluetooth audio support packages in the initial setup. The nuclear approach of clearing configs and restarting everything just helps ensure a clean slate.

Simple as: install proper packages → clear old configs → restart → try again.


Based on the conversation, here's what was actually changed from the initial NixOS setup to fix the Bluetooth headphone pairing:

1. **Audio Stack Changes**:
   - Disabled PulseAudio and switched fully to PipeWire
   - Added WirePlumber as the session manager
   - Set up comprehensive PipeWire configuration with ALSA, JACK, and Pulse support

2. **Bluetooth Configuration Enhancement**:
   - Added detailed Bluetooth settings including audio profiles
   - Enabled `FastConnectable` and `MultiProfile` features
   - Set up proper audio device support through `Enable = "Source,Sink,Media,Socket"`

3. **Package Additions**:
   - Added `bluez-alsa` for Bluetooth audio support
   - Added `wireplumber` for better audio session management
   - Included `pavucontrol` and `alsa-utils` for audio management

4. **User Permissions**:
   - Added user to both `audio` and `bluetooth` groups

5. **Service Addition**:
   - Enabled Blueman service for better Bluetooth management

6. **System Reset Steps**:
   - Cleared old Bluetooth configurations
   - Reset PipeWire/audio settings
   - Performed complete service restart

The key was probably the combination of:
- Having `bluez-alsa` package installed
- Setting up proper PipeWire configuration
- Having the right Bluetooth audio profiles enabled
- Clearing out old configurations and starting fresh

These changes together provided the necessary components for proper Bluetooth audio device support that was missing in the initial setup.

Looking at the conversation, I can break down the Bluetooth issue resolution flow:

**Initial Problem**:
- Sony WH-CH720N headphones wouldn't pair on NixOS (fresh install from Arch)
- Error: `org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationRejected`
- Later error: `org.bluez.Error.InProgress`

**Key Configurations That Led to Solution**:

1. **Core Bluetooth Setup**:
```nix
hardware.bluetooth = {
    enable = true;
    powerOnBoot = true;
    package = pkgs.bluez;
    settings = {
      General = {
        Enable = "Source,Sink,Media,Socket";  # Critical for audio devices
        Experimental = true;
        KernelExperimental = true;
        FastConnectable = true;
        MultiProfile = "multiple";
      };
      Policy = {
        AutoEnable = true;
      };
    };
};
```

2. **Essential Audio/Bluetooth Stack**:
```nix
# Disable PulseAudio in favor of PipeWire
hardware.pulseaudio.enable = false;
security.rtkit.enable = true;

# PipeWire Configuration
services.pipewire = {
    enable = true;
    alsa.enable = true;
    alsa.support32Bit = true;
    pulse.enable = true;
    jack.enable = true;
    wireplumber.enable = true;
};
```

3. **Required Packages**:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    bluez
    bluez-tools
    bluez-alsa
    pavucontrol
    wireplumber
    alsa-utils
];
```

4. **User Permissions**:
```nix
users.users.adityainduraj = {
    extraGroups = [ ... "audio" "bluetooth" ];
};
```

5. **Service Management**:
```nix
services.blueman.enable = true;
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Complete system reset of Bluetooth:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

2. Reset PipeWire:
```bash
systemctl --user stop pipewire pipewire-pulse
rm -rf ~/.config/pulse/*
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse
```

3. System rebuild and reboot:
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
sudo reboot
```

The combination of:
- Proper audio stack configuration (PipeWire + WirePlumber)
- Complete Bluetooth setup with correct audio profiles
- Necessary system packages
- Clean state (removing old Bluetooth and PulseAudio configs)

...appears to have resolved the pairing issues with the Sony headphones.
