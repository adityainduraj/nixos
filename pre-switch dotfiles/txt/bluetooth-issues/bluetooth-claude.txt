i just switched from arch to nixos. i am unable to pair my headphones, which worked fine on arch. they show up in the bluetooth menu but i can't pair to them. they work fine on my phone. i have reset them multiple times. here is the output I get when trying bluetoothctl
[WH-CH720N]# [NEW] Device 5B:9F:83:41:26:BC 5B-9F-83-41-26-BC

[WH-CH720N]# Failed to pair: org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationRejected

This appears to be an authentication issue with your Sony WH-CH720N headphones on NixOS. Let's troubleshoot this systematically:

    First, let's verify that all necessary Bluetooth services are running:

bash

systemctl status bluetooth

    Make sure bluetooth is enabled in your NixOS configuration. Check your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix file has:

nix

hardware.bluetooth = {
  enable = true;
  powerOnBoot = true;
  settings = {
    General = {
      Enable = "Source,Sink,Media,Socket";
    };
  };
};

    Try removing the device completely and repairing:

bash

bluetoothctl
remove 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
scan on
# Wait for device to appear
pair 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

    If that doesn't work, try resetting the Bluetooth daemon:

bash

sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

    You might also need to install and enable additional audio-related packages:

nix

sound.enable = true;
hardware.pulseaudio = {
  enable = true;
  package = pkgs.pulseaudioFull;
};

The "AuthenticationRejected" error typically means the pairing process is failing at the security handshake stage. This could be because:

    The headphones are still paired to another device
    The Bluetooth stack might need additional plugins
    There might be missing codecs or audio profiles

Could you try these steps and let me know what happens? Also, could you share your current audio/bluetooth related configuration from your configuration.nix?

i tried now

The "Error.InProgress" suggests there's already a pairing operation or connection attempt happening in the background. Let's try to clean this up:

    First, let's completely stop any ongoing operations and remove the device:

bash

bluetoothctl
cancel-pairing 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
remove 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
power off
power on

    Then make sure any existing bluetooth processes are cleaned up:

bash

sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

    Now try pairing again, but let's do it step by step:

bash

bluetoothctl
scan on
# Wait until you see your headphones
scan off
pair 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

If you still get errors, could you run these commands and share the output?

bash

journalctl -u bluetooth -n 50
bluetoothctl show

This will help us see if there are any specific errors in the Bluetooth daemon logs or issues with your Bluetooth controller configuration.

[WH-CH720N]# [DEL] Device 4B:C6:9D:2D:24:B2 4B-C6-9D-2D-24-B2
[WH-CH720N]#

Interesting - it shows that the device actually connected successfully (Connected: yes), but it might not be properly set up for audio. Let's try to complete the setup:

    First, check if it's still connected:

bash

bluetoothctl info 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

    If it is connected, let's try to set it up as an audio device:

bash

bluetoothctl
trust 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
connect 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

    Check your audio outputs:

bash

pactl list sinks short

If you don't see your headphones in the audio outputs, let's verify your NixOS bluetooth audio configuration. Could you check if these are in your configuration.nix:

nix

services.pipewire = {
  enable = true;
  alsa.enable = true;
  alsa.support32Bit = true;
  pulse.enable = true;
  wireplumber.enable = true;
};

environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  bluez
  bluez-tools
];

Are you using PipeWire or PulseAudio? This information would help me provide more specific guidance.

I see that while it was momentarily connected, it's not properly paired or trusted. Let's try a more methodical approach:

    First, make sure you're not in discovery mode on any other devices and your headphones are in pairing mode (usually by holding the power button until you hear the pairing prompt).
    Then, let's try this specific sequence:

bash

bluetoothctl
remove 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
scan on
# Wait until you see your WH-CH720N
trust 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
pair 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
connect 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

    If that doesn't work, let's check your Bluetooth service configuration:

bash

systemctl status bluetooth

    And check your Bluetooth controller status:

bash

bluetoothctl show

Also, could you share:

    Which NixOS version you're running (nixos-version)
    The bluetooth-related parts of your configuration.nix
    Whether you're using GNOME, KDE, or another desktop environment

This will help us determine if we need to add any specific desktop environment integration packages or make changes to your Bluetooth configuration.

what should I do? I desperately need this to work.

I notice a few things from your configuration and the output:

    You have both PipeWire and Blueman enabled, which is good, but let's add a few more packages that might help:

Edit your configuration.nix and modify the environment.systemPackages section to include these additional packages:

nix

environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # ... your existing packages ...
  bluez
  bluez-tools
  bluez-alsa
  pavucontrol # Very useful for debugging audio issues
];

    Since you're using GNOME, let's also add these specific packages:

nix

environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # ... your existing packages ...
  gnome.gnome-bluetooth
  gnome.gnome-settings-daemon
];

    Also, let's modify your bluetooth configuration slightly:

nix

hardware.bluetooth = {
  enable = true;
  powerOnBoot = true;
  package = pkgs.bluez;
  settings = {
    General = {
      Enable = "Source,Sink,Media,Socket";
      Experimental = true;
      KernelExperimental = true;
    };
  };
};

After making these changes:

    Save the configuration.nix file
    Run sudo nixos-rebuild switch
    Reboot your system
    Try connecting using GNOME's Settings app instead of bluetoothctl

If it still doesn't work after the reboot:

    Open terminal and run:

bash

sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
killall -9 pulseaudio  # Just in case any pulseaudio instances are running
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

    Then open your headphones' pairing mode and try connecting through GNOME Settings again.

If this still doesn't work, let's try resetting your Bluetooth and PipeWire state completely:

bash

sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
systemctl --user stop pipewire pipewire-pulse
rm -rf ~/.config/pulse/*
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse

Could you try these steps and let me know what happens? Also, could you run systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-pulse and share the output?

Now, here are the step-by-step instructions to fix your Bluetooth issues:

    First, replace your current configuration.nix with the one above:

bash

sudo cp /etc/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.backup  # Backup current config
sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix  # Copy and paste the new configuration

    Apply the new configuration:

bash

sudo nixos-rebuild switch

    Reboot your system:

bash

sudo reboot

    After reboot, reset the Bluetooth and audio system:

bash

# Reset Bluetooth
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

# Reset PipeWire
systemctl --user stop pipewire pipewire-pulse
rm -rf ~/.config/pulse/*
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse

    Make sure all services are running:

bash

systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-pulse
systemctl status bluetooth

    Try connecting your headphones:
        Put your Sony headphones in pairing mode
        Open GNOME Settings
        Go to Bluetooth section
        Click on your headphones to pair

If it doesn't work through GNOME Settings, try through terminal:

bash

bluetoothctl
power off
power on
scan on
# Wait for your headphones to appear
trust 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
pair 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
connect 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

    If you still have issues, check the logs:

bash

journalctl -u bluetooth -n 50

After following these steps, if you're still having issues, try checking the audio output in:

    GNOME Settings → Sound
    Or open pavucontrol (PulseAudio Volume Control) from the applications menu

The key changes in the new configuration include:

    Added WirePlumber session manager
    Enhanced Bluetooth settings
    Added necessary audio and Bluetooth packages
    Added your user to audio and bluetooth groups
    Configured more comprehensive PipeWire settings

Let me know if you need any clarification on any of these steps!

Yes, all the services appear to be running correctly now. Let's try pairing:

    First, make sure your Sony WH-CH720N headphones are in pairing mode:
        Turn them off completely
        Press and hold the power button until you hear "Bluetooth pairing"
    Then let's try pairing through the terminal:

bash

bluetoothctl
power off
power on
scan on

Wait until you see your headphones appear (they should show up with the MAC address starting with 84:D3:52). Then:

bash

trust 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
pair 84:D3:52:32:B3:65
connect 84:D3:52:32:B3:65

If using the terminal doesn't work, try using GNOME Settings:

    Open Settings
    Click on Bluetooth
    Make sure Bluetooth is turned on
    Your headphones should appear as "WH-CH720N"
    Click on them to pair

Let me know what happens and what output or errors you get.
Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
